From graph heat map it shows the correlation between each features on the dataset. It shows that price and mpg has the highest correlation rather than any column on the dataset

![Learning_Curve](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91d7bf03-5d0d-4db0-8ce0-8a7b9b770742)
From the learning curve graph it state that the training and testing error shows a big score it means that the training and testing show a bad score and a highest error because there is no correlation between fuel type and price

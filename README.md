Determine buying a gasoline car, hybrid car, or electric car from the mpg and the price comparison

🎯 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the correlation of the car price based on the features and giving recommendation for people by certain budget. By analyzing car features, we identify the strongest predictors of price and provide insights that can guide car buyers.

🚀 Project Overflow
The Project Follows a structured machine learning:
1. Data Loading
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Train/Test Split
4. Linear Regression Modelling
5. Model Selection
6. Results & Analysis

🔎 Key Findings
• Gasoline car has a lower price rather than Electric car 
• Hard to compare mpg and electric range, so the result if combining dataset has a bad result
• Each dataset has different correlation variable \
• Base MSRP on dataset electric car has an anomaly that contain 0 on 12.000 data so the dataset become bias  

🔬 Future Work
- Expand data collection to include more features of car .
- Makes a new variable that can join both dataset.
- Enhance predictive models using AI for giving recommendation for user by input price or mpg so people can know what type of car suit for them .
